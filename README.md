### Geography

I live in *many* places and none at the same time. 
My body usually resides in the University were I study,
while my mind flies off to various places that exist or don't.

### Reading

I like reading about Chemistry and Computers, two of the Man's 
greatest tools to transform the world around him.

Currently, I read:

-**Introduction to Spectroscopy** by D. Pavia, G. Lampman, G. Kriz, and J. Vyvyan
-**Physical Chemstry** by P. Atkins and J. de Paula
-**Count Zero** by William Gibson

### Food
I only eat things which are edible. For example:
 
1. Hydrocarbons
2. Proteins
3. Lipids
4. Biodegradable plastic

### Contact

The most efficient way to get in contact with me is by touching [me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me)
